# A few fun things I’ve done:

• Got together with a dozen people to create a community/village of like-minded techno-optimists. The project failed, but I learned a lot about biointensive farming—and it’s also where I discovered Bitcoin (this was in 2010). Back then, we used Bitcoin as money to trade veggies, land, labor, etc. No one thought of it as “HODL never spend digital gold.”  

• Bootstrapped Hungary’s crypto ecosystem—[founded the first exchange/brokerage](https://mrcoin.eu) (since exited), launched ATMs (with a highly ranked central bank officer [praising Bitcoin at the inaugural event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDvEgqsbZow)😅), organized educational workshops, meetups, etc. Fun fact: We have the longest-running [Bitcoin Meetup](http://www.bitcoinbudapest.hu) in the world!  

• Erected the first [Satoshi Statue](https://www.youtube.com/live/em74TdeSsbw?t=2363s) in Budapest with four other friends, which became a pilgrimage site for crypto enthusiasts (and is now the default “Satoshi image” in the press).  

• Built a small GPU rig to learn about mining—and it ended up mining Ethereum’s [genesis block](https://x.com/keo/status/1272844823834308608).  

• Helped fund and bootstrap a pirate microschool/homeschooling club for my son 10 years ago because we couldn’t find any alternatives we were happy with. This later became a state-accredited [decentralized network of 18 microschools](https://budapestschool.org/en/) with 800+ students in Hungary.  

• Co-founded [Reaction](https://reaction.global) with Stanford Executive Program classmates—a VC fund focused on solving important problems.  

# What I’m currently working on:

• For the past 15 years, my focus has been on exiting the legacy system and helping others do the same  

• Consulting, primarily helping legacy institutions onboard into crypto—setting up their entire Web3 financial stack (software, policies, training, etc.). I did a Web3 CFO course and pretend I am good at it. Why am I good at this? Because I learn from other's people mistake who took my advice 😂  

• Learning a lot about AI—both top-down (user perspective) and bottom-up (math and first principles).  

• Beginner Muay Thai aspirant
